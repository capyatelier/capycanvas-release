## Optional native codec reference tools

Application photo decoding, encoding and previews use shared Rust codecs.
The C/C++ programs under `tools/validation/photo-codecs/` are optional independent
interoperability oracles, excluded from application builds and packages.

Their pinned recipe builds libheif 1.23.4 and libde265 1.1.3 (LGPL-3.0-or-later),
libavif 1.4.2 and dav1d 1.5.3 (BSD-2-Clause), libultrahdr 2.0.0 (Apache-2.0),
libaom 3.14.1 (BSD-2-Clause and the AOM patent license), and libjpeg-turbo 3.1.4.1
(IJG, BSD-3-Clause and zlib for the applicable components). Exact source hashes
and license filenames are in `tools/validation/photo-codecs/photo-codecs.json`.
Running that reference build retains original notices, corresponding sources,
local patch and build recipe with the generated reference libraries. The narrow
Capy bridge and helper use the project's MIT OR Apache-2.0 terms. The libheif
source-metadata patch retains upstream's LGPL-3.0-or-later terms.

## Oklab color conversion — MIT

The `working_to_oklab` and `working_from_oklab` functions in
`crates/layer-render-wgpu/src/working_color.wgsl` adapt Björn Ottosson's
[reference implementation](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/).
The local implementation uses WGSL vectors, signed cube roots and document-primary
transforms. Native Float32 output preserves extended RGB. We use the author's
MIT license option and preserve the
[original notice](https://bottosson.github.io/misc/License.txt) below.

## Okhsv color conversion — MIT

`crates/layer-ui/src/color/okhsv.rs` adapts Björn Ottosson's
[Okhsv reference implementation](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/colorpicker/).
It uses double-precision intermediates, three gamut-boundary refinement steps,
explicit neutral/black handling, and caches hue-only terms for field rendering.

## Output dithering hash — public domain

`crates/layer-color/src/icc/output/quantize.rs` adapts the SplitMix64 mixing
function from [Sebastiano Vigna's 2015 reference](https://prng.di.unimi.it/splitmix64.c).
The author dedicates the code to the public domain and permits use, copying,
modification and distribution. The source is supplied without warranty. We use
pixel coordinates instead of mutable generator state for repeatable output.

## fasteval — MIT

Numeric expressions use `fasteval` 0.2.4, downloaded as a Cargo dependency.

## Dependencies and binary releases

The Android frontend uses AndroidX/Jetpack Compose and
[AndroidSVG 1.4](https://github.com/BigBadaboom/androidsvg), under Apache-2.0.
AndroidSVG (copyright Paul LeBeau, Cave Rock Software Ltd.) renders the existing
project-owned UI icons; no external brush artwork or icon set is imported.
The generated Gradle wrapper is provided by Gradle under Apache-2.0. Android SDK,
NDK and emulator packages are development tools installed separately, not vendored
or included as source assets. Android binary releases must collect notices for
their exact Maven and native dependencies as well as the notices below.

The published wgpu 30.0.1 `wgpu`, `wgpu-hal` and `wgpu-types` crates are included
under [vendor](vendor/README.md) with a local Vulkan color pass-through patch.
They retain their MIT OR Apache-2.0 licenses and copyright notices; each package
contains `LICENSE.MIT` and `LICENSE.APACHE`.

Cargo downloads other dependencies separately. `Cargo.lock` records exact
versions and registry checksums. [deny.toml](deny.toml) enforces the reviewed Rust license allowlist,
including build/dev dependencies and non-Linux targets. An allowed license is
not permission to omit its copyright notices or other distribution conditions.

The native frontend uses GTK, libadwaita and their system dependencies. Normal
Linux packages include a replaceable GTK 4.22.4 library with the null-surface
tablet-pad startup guard. Its LGPL-2.1-or-later license, complete pinned upstream
source, local patch, build recipe and hash manifest are shipped under
`share/doc/capycanvas-gtk`; the library is in `lib/capycanvas/gtk`. Libadwaita
and GTK's dependencies remain separately installed. They are not relicensed to
Apache-2.0. In particular,
[GTK](https://www.gtk.org/docs/architecture/) and
[libadwaita](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libadwaita/-/blob/main/COPYING)
have LGPL obligations; using their public APIs is distinct from copying their
implementation or artwork into this repository.

The MIT option facilitates reuse of our own code in GPLv2 projects, but does not
guarantee that the entire dependency graph is GPLv2-compatible. Apache-only
dependencies must be assessed separately by downstream users.

Before distributing native executables, WebAssembly bundles, containers or
vendored source archives, collect notices and license texts for the exact
shipped dependency/toolchain artifacts. If shipping LGPL libraries, also satisfy
their applicable source, replacement/relinking and notice requirements. This
source audit is not a completed binary-distribution compliance package.

## Skia RWTMO tone mapping

The reference-white tone mapping implementation in
`crates/layer-core/src/color/hdr/sdr.rs` and
`crates/layer-render-wgpu/src/hdr_mapping.wgsl`, and the independent reference
in `tools/validation/rwtmo_reference.cpp`, are adapted from
Skia `src/codec/SkHdrAgtm.cpp`, commit
`bc94efd2229aad1048edbf892a6b2e7db28b22c4`.

## OpenEXR Rust codec dependencies

The Float32 interchange reader/writer uses `exr` 1.74.0 (BSD-3-Clause),
`lebe` 0.5.3 (BSD-3-Clause), `bit_field` 0.10.3 (MIT option), and
`zune-inflate` 0.2.54 (MIT OR Apache-2.0 OR Zlib). Cargo.lock pins these versions.

### rav1e AV1 patent notice

The upstream PATENTS file is reproduced below, transcoded from Windows-1252
to UTF-8 without changing its wording.

```text
Alliance for Open Media Patent License 1.0

1. License Terms.

1.1. Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
     Licensor, on behalf of itself and successors in interest and assigns,
     grants Licensee a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
     no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as expressly stated in this
     License) patent license to its Necessary Claims to make, use, sell, offer
     for sale, import or distribute any Implementation.

1.2. Conditions.

1.2.2. Additional Conditions. This license is directly from Licensor to
       Licensee.  Licensee acknowledges as a condition of benefiting from it
       that no rights from Licensor are received from suppliers, distributors,
       or otherwise in connection with this License.

1.3. Defensive Termination. If any Licensee, its Affiliates, or its agents
     initiates patent litigation or files, maintains, or voluntarily
     participates in a lawsuit against another entity or any person asserting
     that any Implementation infringes Necessary Claims, any patent licenses
     granted under this License directly to the Licensee are immediately
     terminated as of the date of the initiation of action unless 1) that suit
     was in response to a corresponding suit regarding an Implementation first
     brought against an initiating entity, or 2) that suit was brought to
     enforce the terms of this License (including intervention in a third-party
     action by a Licensee).

1.4. Disclaimers. The Reference Implementation and Specification are provided
     "AS IS" and without warranty. The entire risk as to implementing or
     otherwise using the Reference Implementation or Specification is assumed
     by the implementer and user. Licensor expressly disclaims any warranties
     (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of
     merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or
     title, related to the material. IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO
