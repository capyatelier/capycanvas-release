# Third-party notices

Capy Canvas's original code and non-brand assets are licensed under
[MIT OR Apache-2.0](LICENSE), at the recipient's option. Third-party material
retains its own terms; our dual license does not relicense dependencies.
The project-owned capybara mark is a separate exception under [BRANDING.md](BRANDING.md).

## Native HEIF/AVIF photo decoders

GTK packages include dynamically loaded libheif 1.23.4 and libde265 1.1.3
(LGPL-3.0-or-later), plus libavif 1.4.2 and dav1d 1.5.3 (BSD-2-Clause). Their original licenses,
corresponding source archives, pinned checksums, local patch and build recipe
are included in `share/doc/capycanvas-photo-codecs/` in the native package.
These shared libraries remain replaceable in `lib/capycanvas/photo/`.

The narrow Capy Canvas C bridge uses the project's MIT OR Apache-2.0 terms.
The libheif patch preserves source color metadata after RGB conversion and
retains libheif's original license. See [codec provenance](vendor/README.md#heifavif-source-color-preservation).

## Oklab color conversion — MIT

The `working_to_oklab` and `working_from_oklab` functions in
`crates/layer-render-wgpu/src/working_color.wgsl` adapt Björn Ottosson's
[reference implementation](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/).
The local implementation uses WGSL vectors, signed cube roots and document-primary
transforms. Native Float32 output preserves extended RGB. We use the author's
MIT license option and preserve the
[original notice](https://bottosson.github.io/misc/License.txt) below.

## Okhsv color conversion — MIT

`crates/layer-ui/src/color/okhsv.rs` adapts Björn Ottosson's
[Okhsv reference implementation](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/colorpicker/).
It uses double-precision intermediates, three gamut-boundary refinement steps,
explicit neutral/black handling, and caches hue-only terms for field rendering.

## Output dithering hash — public domain

`crates/layer-color/src/icc/output/quantize.rs` adapts the SplitMix64 mixing
function from [Sebastiano Vigna's 2015 reference](https://prng.di.unimi.it/splitmix64.c).
The author dedicates the code to the public domain and permits use, copying,
modification and distribution. The source is supplied without warranty. We use
pixel coordinates instead of mutable generator state for repeatable output.

## fasteval — MIT

Numeric expressions use `fasteval` 0.2.4, downloaded as a Cargo dependency.

## Dependencies and binary releases

The Android frontend uses AndroidX/Jetpack Compose and
[AndroidSVG 1.4](https://github.com/BigBadaboom/androidsvg), under Apache-2.0.
AndroidSVG (copyright Paul LeBeau, Cave Rock Software Ltd.) renders the existing
project-owned UI icons; no external brush artwork or icon set is imported.
The generated Gradle wrapper is provided by Gradle under Apache-2.0. Android SDK,
NDK and emulator packages are development tools installed separately, not vendored
or included as source assets. Android binary releases must collect notices for
their exact Maven and native dependencies as well as the notices below.

The published wgpu 30.0.1 `wgpu`, `wgpu-hal` and `wgpu-types` crates are included
under [vendor](vendor/README.md) with a local Vulkan color pass-through patch.
They retain their MIT OR Apache-2.0 licenses and copyright notices; each package
contains `LICENSE.MIT` and `LICENSE.APACHE`.

Cargo downloads other dependencies separately. `Cargo.lock` records exact
versions and registry checksums. [deny.toml](deny.toml) enforces the reviewed Rust license allowlist,
including build/dev dependencies and non-Linux targets. An allowed license is
not permission to omit its copyright notices or other distribution conditions.

The native frontend uses separately installed GTK, libadwaita and their system
dependencies. They are not relicensed to Apache-2.0. In particular,
[GTK](https://www.gtk.org/docs/architecture/) and
[libadwaita](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libadwaita/-/blob/main/COPYING)
have LGPL obligations; using their public APIs is distinct from copying their
implementation or artwork into this repository.

The MIT option facilitates reuse of our own code in GPLv2 projects, but does not
guarantee that the entire dependency graph is GPLv2-compatible. Apache-only
dependencies must be assessed separately by downstream users.

Before distributing native executables, WebAssembly bundles, containers or
vendored source archives, collect notices and license texts for the exact
shipped dependency/toolchain artifacts. If shipping LGPL libraries, also satisfy
their applicable source, replacement/relinking and notice requirements. This
source audit is not a completed binary-distribution compliance package.
